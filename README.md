# Apple_Clone

Here's the demo 
 https://Shreyansh575.github.io/Apple-Clone/

 I have created a clone of the original Apple website using React and Tailwind CSS. I also used GSAP animations to add smooth and interactive effects to the website. This project helped me understand how modern websites are built and how animations work in real projects. While working on this clone, I improved my skills in React components, Tailwind utility classes, and GSAP animations.
